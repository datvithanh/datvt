microdosing fear is not talked about enough. existing outside of your comfort zone all the time is exhausting, and the natural reaction when you are exhausted is to retreat to your comfort zone.

this pendulum will swing back and forth throughout your life unless you find a psychological sweet spot of having just enough amount of fear to fuel your growth

find your own ways to microdose your fears

***

suspecting being in the sweet spot all the time is not feasible, because your pain threshold fluctuates by the second depending on your physical and psych states

so having some kind of safety net when you get into the *too* comfortable zone or the *too* uncomfortable zone is also important

***

retreating is completely fine if its not associated with a sense of defeat, disappointment, shame, embarrassment,... which happens all the time

being in a state of exhaustion does intensify these emotions. and strips you your sense of agency and a bunch of other things that makes life worthwhile, for an extended amount of time
