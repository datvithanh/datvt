Mostly to document existing or on-going project, i have too many at the same time, i forget all of them when i look back. This is a focus and priority problem that needs to be looked at soon

Anyways, this is the list
- Jan 2024: [obsidian publish extension](https://github.com/datvithanh/obsidian-note-extraction)
	- what does this do?
		- 1. scan my big obsidian vault
		- 2. move files with a certain tag to a designated folder (not configurable yet, currently `./publish/`)
			- Configurable: tag, content folder, attachment folder
		- 3. sync this folder with [folder](https://github.com/datvithanh/datvt/tree/v4/content) along with attachments
		- 4. need to go to local repo to push
	- I wonder if i can automate this whole process with github action, because i do backup my main vault with a private repo
		- This would probably takes way too much time and my priority for this website is to put things into words
