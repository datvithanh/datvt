dat has a billion interests and no particular talent. this website is for him to explore all of those interests publicly :D

last 2 years
- working on and learning about distributed systems at 9-5
- outside of 9-5: find communities, connect to people, foster okay-ness and confidence
- met a lot of cool friends along the way and i'm grateful for all of them

dat recently rediscovered his passion for (data) visualization and found out (on the last week of 2023, thanks to threads) that he likes to model stuff as complex systems

rekindling his love with prototyping, building software products
