ur literally crawling in my mind if you're reading this lol

i'm pointing myself towards a couple of things. that's a softer way to say that i'm trying to be better at these things. currently, i think i'm not deliberately trying to be good at anything, i'd just show up and enjoy the things i'm doing, the better-ing will happen itself. anyways here's the list

- Programming
	- Scoping 
	- Systems
	- nvim?
	- thinking in system
		- hmm these are not actionable enough...
- Mind
	- IFS
	- Focusing
	- Meditation
		- Mark's meditation book
		- Vajrayana mostly through vividness dot live (? is it even meditation idk yet)
- Body
	- Contact improv
		- at least once a month via the monthly sigma jam
	- Bouldering
		- at least once a week at fitbloc :D


writing to me, is hard. but it's getting easier
writing bs is not that hard. writing good stuff is hard
