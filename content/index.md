Hi! 

It's Dat, I'm currently working as a backend engineer in Order team at Shopee.

In 2024, I'm rekindling my interest in prototyping and building products

In the last 2 years
- I've been working on and learning about large-scale software development and distributed systems at Shopee
	- Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer 
- Outside of my 9-5, I have been doing some inner work, finding communities, connecting to people, and trying to foster [deep okayness](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love) and confidence. I've met a lot of amazing friends along the way and I'm grateful for all of them

I'm a big fan of lists, it's how I keep track of my things ([[Unsorted list]])
- [[list - projects]]
- [[list - tech]]
- [[list - experiments]]
- [[list - books I'm reading]]
- [[list - hobbies + interests]]

There's a `my` prefix because I have a filter in Obsidian (I'm editing this website in Obsidian) that lists out all of `my` notes lol. I often scan and update them
