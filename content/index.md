Hi! 

It's Dat, I'm currently working as a backend engineer in Order team at Shopee

I'm rekindling my interest in prototyping and building products. One of my goals in 2024 is to publish some kind of product or software :D

In the last 2 years
- I've been working on and learning about large-scale software development and distributed systems at Shopee
	- Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer 
- Outside of my 9-5, I have been doing some inner work, finding communities, connecting to people, and trying to foster [deep okayness](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love) and confidence. I've met a lot of amazing friends along the way and I'm grateful for all of them

inner work stack
- IFS
- Meditation
- like once a month

productivity stack
- coffee

currently reading
- no bad parts, a book on [[internal family system]]
- [[non-violent communication]]
- something something database
- ...
