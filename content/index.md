Welcome to my slop texts (?), a front row seat to me losing my mind!

It's Dat, I'm currently working as a backend engineer in Order team at Shopee

I'm rekindling my interest in prototyping and building products. One of my goals in 2024 is to publish some kind of product or software :D

In the last 2 years
- I've been working on and learning about large-scale software development and distributed systems at Shopee
	- Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer 
- Outside of my 9-5, I have been doing some inner work, finding communities, connecting to people, and trying to foster [deep okayness](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love) and confidence. I've met a lot of amazing friends along the way and I'm grateful for all of them

I'm a big fan of lists, it's how I keep track of my things ([[Unsorted list]])
- [[list - projects]]
- [[list - tech]]
- [[list - experiments]]
- [[list - books I'm reading]]
- [[list - hobbies + interests]]
